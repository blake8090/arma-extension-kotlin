## About

An example extension for Arma 3 written using Kotlin Native.

This unlocks the possibility to write Arma 3 scripts almost entirely in Kotlin instead of C, C++ or C#.

## Getting Started

### Building

1. Clone the repo
2. Run the `linkNative` Gradle task
3. Starting in the root project folder, navigate to `build/bin/native/debugShared` or `build/bin/native/releaseShared`
4. Copy `TestExtension_x64.dll` to your root Arma 3 folder

## TODO

- Add callback example
